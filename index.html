            <p>I am from Hays, Kansas. I attended the University of Kansas for my undergraduate degree. I obtained my MBA in 2011 from the University of Kansas. In that time, I began to study financial modeling and analytics. This is where my love of technology
                and software began to grow. After I departed from the University of Kansas, I moved to Washington D.C., to begin my career. I started as a lowly audit liaison at the Pentagon, but quickly advanced to building my own little analytics empire.
                This was very enjoyable, and I found the work very satisfying, as well.
                <br> I moved back to Hays, Kansas in March of 2016. I made the move for a number of reasons. Most important being that I had a son baking in his mother's stomach and I planned on being present for everything. Currently, I am working for
                an oil services company called Hess Services. In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, gofing, skiing, doing crossword puzzles, and traveling.
